## Today I'd like to talk about

- What's a design pattern
- Service Layer
- REST
- Middleware
- Real-time 
- GraphQL (‚ùì)

## What's a Design Pattern?

*Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.*

---

## Service Layer

*Defines an application‚Äôs boundary with a layer of services that establishes a set of available operations and coordinates the application‚Äôs response in each operation.*

<CodeSurfer
  theme={highlighter}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/service-layer.js").default}
  lang="js"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
/>

---

## Service Layer Advantages

- __Separation of Concerns and Testability:__ Test the application logic separate from how it is being accessed.
- __Self documenting:__ New developers can see what the application provides in the context of the programming language
- __Transport agnostic:__ Clients like a CLI, GUI or web framework can use the service layer directly.

---

## REST

__Re__presentational __S__tate __T__ransfer is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating web APIs.

---

## REST Constraints

- __Client-Server:__ Server: Data storage and application logic; Client: Requesting and displaying
- __Statelessness:__ Client sends all information to process request.
- __Caching:__ Non-modifying requests can be cached.
- __Layered System:__ Allows for intermediaries
- __Uniform Interface:__ Well defined operations to execute on resources.

---

## REST Resources and Operations

A resource can be anything that is uniquely addressable.

- __GET:__ Read a single or a list of resources
- __POST:__ Create a new resource
- __PUT:__ Replaces resource(s) with new data
- __PATCH:__ Merges the resource(s) with new data
- __DELETE:__ Delete the resource(s) at location

---

## REST Service Layer

| HTTP method | Service layer method |
| --- | --- |
| GET /messages      | messages.find() |
| GET /messages/1    | messages.get(1) |
| POST /messages     | messages.create(body) |
| PUT /messages/1    | messages.update(1, body) |
| PATCH /messages/1  | messages.patch(1, body) |
| DELETE /messages/1 | messages.remove(1, body) |


---

<CodeSurfer
  theme={highlighter}
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/message-service.js").default}
  lang="js"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
/>

---

## REST Services

- Combine advantages of service layer and REST resources
- HTTP-friendly but protocol independent
- No need for repetitive GET, POST etc. handlers and routes
- Easy to document, test and re-use

---

## Middleware

Workflows and cross-cutting concerns that can be added to services dynamically, e.g.

- Validation
- Checking permissions
- Sending email on new user
- Notifying clients about changes

## Real-time

| HTTP method | Service layer method | Real-time event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET /messages      | messages.find() | - |
| GET /messages/1    | messages.get(1) | - |
| POST /messages     | messages.create(body) | `message created` |
| PUT /messages/1    | messages.update(1, body) | `message updated` |
| PATCH /messages/1  | messages.patch(1, body) | `message patched` |
| DELETE /users/1 | messages.remove(1, body) | `message removed` |

---

---

## Putting it all Together

- __Service layer:__ Interface to our application logic
- __REST:__ An architectural design principle for creating web APIs
- __RESTful services:__ A service layer that follows the REST architecture
- __Middleware:__ Reusable functions that can control the flow of data
- __Real-time:__ Events that can be sent automatically when following the REST architecture
